In his review of the book for the New York Herald Tribune, the great sports writer Red Smith called it “an honest book that furnished an insight into the ballplayer’s life which no outsider could possibly get … a cocky book, caustic and candid and, in a way, courageous.”  And also worth your time is the short story, “Alibi Ike,” written by Ring Lardner, once of the Chicago Tribune, and called by Adam Gopnik in the current issue of the New Yorker, “certainly the single funniest baseball story ever written.” But he is vividly alive on the pages of his “The Long Season,” a diary of the 1959 days he played for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Reds, published in 1960.
